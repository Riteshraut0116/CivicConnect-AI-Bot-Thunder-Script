**#CivicConnect AI: Smart Grievance & Service Bot#**

This project is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for an AI-powered chatbot designed to streamline citizen interactions with municipal services. It demonstrates automated grievance reporting and intelligent FAQ answering, aiming to improve citizen satisfaction and municipal efficiency.

Features (MVP)
Web Chat Interface: A simple, interactive chat window accessible via a web browser.

Grievance Reporting: Citizens can report issues (e.g., potholes, water supply problems) by describing them in natural language. The bot will capture essential details and "log" the grievance.

FAQ Answering: The bot can provide instant answers to predefined common questions about municipal services (e.g., "How to apply for a birth certificate?").

AI Integration: Leverages Google Dialogflow for natural language understanding (NLU) and intent recognition.

Simple Persistence: Grievances are stored in a local JSON file for demonstration purposes.

Setup and Running
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python installed.

Google Cloud Project & Dialogflow Agent:

Create a Google Cloud Project.

Enable the Dialogflow API for your project.

Create a new Dialogflow ES (Essentials) agent.

Crucially: Create a service account key (JSON file) and download it. You will need to set the path to this file as an environment variable (GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS).

Train your Dialogflow Agent:

Intent 1: Report_Grievance:

Training phrases: "I want to report a pothole", "There's a water leakage in my area", "Garbage hasn't been collected", "Complain about streetlights", "Issue with public transport".

Entities: Consider creating entities for location (e.g., @sys.location), issue_type (e.g., @issue_type: pothole, water leakage, garbage, streetlight, transport).

Response: "Thank you for reporting. Can you please provide more details like the exact location and a brief description of the issue?" (This will be handled by our Flask app logic).

Intent 2: FAQ_Birth_Certificate:

Training phrases: "How to get a birth certificate?", "What's the process for birth certificate?", "Documents for birth certificate".

Response: "To apply for a birth certificate, you typically need: 1. Application form. 2. Hospital discharge summary. 3. Parent's ID proof. Please visit your local municipal office or their official website for exact details."

Intent 3: FAQ_Property_Tax:

Training phrases: "How to pay property tax?", "Property tax rates", "Property tax information".

Response: "Property tax can usually be paid online via the municipal corporation's website or at designated payment centers. Rates vary by property type and location. Please check your city's municipal website for current rates."

Default Welcome Intent: Keep the default welcome intent.

Default Fallback Intent: Keep the default fallback intent.

Install Python Dependencies:

pip install Flask google-cloud-dialogflow

Step-by-Step Guide
Clone or Download: Get the project files and set up the directory structure as shown above.

Google Cloud Credentials:

Place your downloaded Dialogflow service account JSON key file in a secure location (e.g., dialogflow_config/service_account.json - do not commit this file to public repositories!).

Set the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the path of this JSON file.

Linux/macOS:

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/dialogflow_config/service_account.json"

Windows (Command Prompt):

set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\your\dialogflow_config\service_account.json"

Windows (PowerShell):

$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\your\dialogflow_config\service_account.json"

Update app.py:

Open app.py.

Replace YOUR_DIALOGFLOW_PROJECT_ID with your actual Google Cloud Project ID where your Dialogflow agent is hosted.

Run the Flask Application:

Navigate to the civicconnect-ai directory in your terminal.

Run:

python app.py

The application will start, usually on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Open in Browser: Open your web browser and go to the URL provided by Flask (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

How to Interact
Report a Grievance: Type messages like "I want to report a pothole on MG Road near the railway station." or "There's a water leakage issue in Sector 17, Building C."

Ask an FAQ: Type questions like "How can I get a birth certificate?" or "What's the process for property tax payment?"

General Chat: For anything not matching a specific intent, the bot will use its default fallback or try to respond generally.

Next Steps / Potential Enhancements
Advanced Grievance Details: Capture more structured data (e.g., exact address, contact info) and integrate with a real database (like Firestore).

Image/Voice Input: Allow users to upload photos of issues or speak their queries.

Proactive Notifications: Integrate with SMS/email to send updates on grievance status.

Multilingual Expansion: Fully implement Dialogflow's multilingual capabilities.

Integration with Municipal Systems: Connect to actual government APIs for real-time data and updates.

User Authentication: Secure user accounts for personalized services.

Deployment: Deploy to a cloud platform (Azure App Service, Google App Engine) for public access.
